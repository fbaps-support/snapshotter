This is a simple "snapshot backup" script. It can use a variety of
snapshotting technologies to take copies of a filesystem or directory
and manages pruning of those snapshots according to a specified
retention schedule.

The "snapshotter" perl script has basic documentation - try 
"perldoc snapshotter"

The "examples" directory contains a few example configs we've been 
using here.
